# Format: YAML-ish key:value lines (machine-parseable)
# One file per repository root when multiple projects exist.
# The tracer/agent MUST read this file first when present.

  Solution manifest listing individual projects contained in this repository.
  Each project has its own project manifest (.tproj) file referenced by `path`.
projects:
  - project.name: trac-spec-alpha
    project.id: P-001
    path: ./services/spec-agent
    manifest: ./services/spec-agent/.trac/trac-spec-alpha.tproj
  - project.name: example-api
    project.id: P-002
    path: ./examples/example-api
    manifest: ./examples/example-api/.trac/example-api.tproj

# Controls/flags that apply at the solution level (agents must merge these with per-project .tproj)
fetch_rates_on_generate: true
commit_generated_artifacts: true
sync_with_github_issues: true

# Global allowed sources for cost/hours; per-project .tproj may narrow this list

notes: |
  - Agents MUST enumerate `projects[]` and allow the user or caller to select which project (or subset) the generation should target.
  - If a prompt targets the whole solution, agents must produce per-project spec artifacts and a solution-level summary.
